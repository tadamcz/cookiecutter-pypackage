- More lightweight; removed a bunch of non-critical files
- Added configuration for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Added configuration for [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and BlackConnect for PyCharm
- Added starter configuration for deployments with [Dokku](https://dokku.com/) (optional)
